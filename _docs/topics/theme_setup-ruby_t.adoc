.Why Wha Runtime?
****
A runtime environment is a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications of a given language.
Since pretty much all Ruby applications are built on massive arrays of open-source components, and since they are intended to be OS-agnostic, a runtime environment is what ensures Ruby apps work the same on all operating systems.

As you might expect, installation is a non-trivial matter for software designed to run the same on all OSes.
But once Ruby runtime is up and running, you wont' really have to fuss with it.
