= Algolia Search Integration

A cloud account with Algolia is required to implement Algolia as a cloud-search provider.

[WARNING]
By default, AsciiDocsy's own Algolia application is configured in the repo.
You will be able to generate local content packages for it, or query its live indices, but you will not be able to write (push) to the cloud indices.

The link:https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up[Algolia signup] is free.
You only start paying when you use certain thresholds of index space or query bandwidth.

AsciiDocsy's implementation of Algolia's Jekyll plugin (link:https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia[source]) (link:https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/getting-started.html[docs]) and instantsearch form (link:https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/documentation/[docs]).

The `site.algolia` object (by default defined in `_config.yml`, but you could move it to an auxiliary config file and <</docs/theme/advanced#,call multiple configs>>).
