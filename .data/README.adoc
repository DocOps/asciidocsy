= AsciiDocsy Product Data

The `.data/` path is for _product data about the AsciiDocsy theme itself_.
To avoid confusion, files in this directory can be incorporated into your application if you wish -- just please be sure to reorient them to your own product.

This is data that is generally part of a product source repository.
And in this case, AsciiDocsy is the product.
The AsciiDocsy site itself is configured to incorporate some of this data, such as the Release History, based on the `.data/revisions.yml` file.
